The dataset for StackOverflow is a set of files, each of them contains one XML record per line.

The dataset is currently hosted in archive.org

With the default inputformat from Hadoop, each Map call will receive one single item with the structure specified in the documentation, encoded in the Text value.
In order to simplify its parsing, we recommend the following approach (Taken from Miner D. & Shook, A, "MapReduce Design Patterns", O' Reilly, 2013)

The following util class has the transformXmlToMap(String xml) method that simplifies parsing of stackoverflow data format.

Once you have parsed the xml string with the method, you can directly access its attributes getting the requested key from the Map.
Map<String, String> parsed = transformXmlToMap(xmlString);
String strDate = parsed.get(creationDate);
String userId = parsed.get(userId);
